A deep learning model that transcribes audio in Cantonese into Chinese characters, which in turn are converted to the CHAT linguistic form.  

I will be using PyCantonese to do the conversion from text to CHAT. Meanwhile, there should be a separate directory that accesses a suitable API for speech-to-text conversion in the cloud.
